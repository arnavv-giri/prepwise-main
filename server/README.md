# SkillTrack Server

Backend service for SkillTrack — responsible for authentication, problem management, evaluation orchestration, and system state.

It acts as the central coordinator between the frontend and the execution engine.

---

## ⚙️ Role in System

The server handles:

- User authentication and authorization  
- Problem and curriculum management  
- Submission handling and evaluation requests  
- Communication with the execution engine  
- Progress tracking and leaderboard generation  

---

## 🔄 Request Flow

1. Client sends request (auth / problem / submission)  
2. Server validates request and user permissions  
3. For code execution:
   - forwards request to execution engine  
   - receives execution results  
4. Stores results and updates progress  
5. Sends response back to client
