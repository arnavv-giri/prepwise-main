# SkillTrack

SkillTrack is a pattern-based DSA interview platform built around one core challenge:

> How do you safely execute untrusted user code while keeping the system scalable, reliable, and secure?

It combines structured learning with a real execution engine using a multi-service architecture.

---

## ⚙️ System Architecture

SkillTrack is built as three independent services:

```plaintext
SkillTrack/
│
├── client/             # React frontend (UI layer)
├── server/             # API, authentication, database
└── execution-engine/   # Docker-based code execution sandbox
```
### Why this design?

- Isolates untrusted code execution from the main backend  
- Prevents crashes or exploits from affecting core services  
- Enables independent scaling of execution workloads  

---

## 🔄 Execution Flow

1. User writes code in the frontend  
2. Code is sent to the backend API  
3. Backend forwards execution request to the execution engine  
4. Execution engine:
   - Spins up a Docker container  
   - Executes code against test cases  
   - Captures output, errors, and runtime  
5. Results are returned to backend → frontend  

---

## 🎯 Core Philosophy

SkillTrack moves beyond random problem-solving by focusing on:

- Structured DSA curriculum (12 patterns)  
- Ordered progression system  
- Hybrid learning (guided + free exploration)  
- Real execution environment  
- Production-level system design

## 🧠 Key Design Decisions

### Docker-based Isolation
- Each submission runs inside a container  
- Prevents access to host system  
- Ensures consistent runtime environment  

### Multi-Language Support
- JavaScript, Python, C++  
- Separate execution pipelines per language  

### Public vs Private Test Cases
- Public → visible for debugging  
- Private → used for final evaluation  

### 3-Service Architecture
- Clear separation of concerns  
- Improves fault isolation  
- Enables scalability

### Clone

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Jashan1001/skilltrack.git
cd skilltrack
```
---

### Server

```bash
cd server
npm install
npm run dev
```

Create `.env`:

PORT=
MONGO_URI=
JWT_SECRET=

---

### Client

```bash
cd client
npm install
npm run dev
```
---

### Execution Engine

```bash
cd execution-engine
npm install

## 🌱 Seeding Structured Curriculum

Server includes seed scripts for:

* Patterns
* Master track problems
* Ordered progression

Run:

```bash
npm run seed
```
---

## 🔐 Security Considerations

* Docker isolation for untrusted code execution
* JWT-based authentication with protected routes
* Role-based access control
* Hidden private test cases to prevent hardcoding

---

## 📈 Vision

SkillTrack focuses on structured mastery over random practice by combining:

* Guided learning paths
* Real execution environment
* Production-level architecture
